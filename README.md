* Item 1 In my third year in HoChiMinh University, I have a Subject called System Performance Evaluation\
* Item 2 I learnt some lessons about Methods of Evaluating the Performance (time, resource, complexipility, accuracy, applicability) of Systems\
* Item 3 And my Assignment is to simulation a system defined: consists of 2 M/M/1 queues, when a Program leaves 1st Queue, it will come in 2nd Queue with rate 0.8, and so, 0.2 is the rate it comeback to 1st Queue.\
* Item 4 The Goal of my Work is Simulating the Action of the System in fixed time range and Compare the Simulated System Configuration to the Theoritical\ 
* Item 5 I simulated the System by Python on Visual Studio Code (You can view my code in .py file)\
* Item 6 My Report is written by Vietnamese to it's quite inconvenient for almost to check-out my repository\
* Item 7 Please contact me thourgh Gmail if you want more either information or explaination about my work\
* Item 8 Regard!
M/M/1 queue model:\
-The number of customers arriving in a time interval t follows a Poisson Process with parameter λ.\
-The interval between any two successive arrivals is exponentially distributed with parameter λ.\
-The time taken to complete a single service is exponentially distributed with parameter μ.\
-The number of server is one.\
-Although not explicitly stated both the population and the queue size can be infinity.\
-The order of service is assumed to be FIFO.\
