In my third year in HoChiMinh University, I have a Subject called System Performance Evaluation\
I learnt some lessons about Methods of Evaluating the Performance (time, resource, complexipility, accuracy, applicability) of Systems\
And my Assignment is to simulation a system defined: consists of 2 M/M/1 queues, when a Program leaves 1st Queue, it will come in 2nd Queue with rate 0.8, and so, 0.2 is the rate it comeback to 1st Queue.\
The Goal of my Work is Simulating the Action of the System in fixed time range and Compare the Simulated System Configuration to the Theoritical\ 
I simulated the System by Python on Visual Studio Code (You can view my code in .py file)\
My Report is written by Vietnamese to it's quite inconvenient for almost to check-out my repository\
Please contact me thourgh Gmail if you want more either information or explaination about my work\
Regard!
M/M/1 queue model:\
-The number of customers arriving in a time interval t follows a Poisson Process with parameter λ.\
-The interval between any two successive arrivals is exponentially distributed with parameter λ.\
-The time taken to complete a single service is exponentially distributed with parameter μ.\
-The number of server is one.\
-Although not explicitly stated both the population and the queue size can be infinity.\
-The order of service is assumed to be FIFO.\
